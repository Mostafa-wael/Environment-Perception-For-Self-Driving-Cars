# Environment-Perception-For-Self-Driving-Cars
This is an assignment from "Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars" course of the "Self-Driving Cars Specialization" on Coursera.org.

This assignmnet aims at extracting useful scene information to allow self-driving cars to safely and reliably traverse their environment, throught 4 main tasks as follows:
- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement lane estimation.
- Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the output of 2D object detectors. 
- Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
